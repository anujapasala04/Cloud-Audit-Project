While voter preferences for voting in parliamentary and 2019 Assembly elections can often differ, the completion of this “cycle” allows us to explore what the next Lok Sabha might look like if people vote in exactly the same fashion as they did in their last Assembly elections. The analysis, based on data from the Election Commission of India and the now defunct India-Votes.com, is straightforward—we assume that everyone who voted in their respective states’ last Assembly elections will also turn up to vote in the 2019 general elections and will vote for the same party as they did in the Assembly elections.
