Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field with a rectangular pitch at the center. The objective is to score more runs than the opposing team, with runs accumulated by hitting the ball and running between wickets. It's a popular sport, particularly in countries like England, India, Australia, and others with historical ties to British colonialism.
