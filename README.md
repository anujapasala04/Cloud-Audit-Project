🚀 Rapid Fast Public Audits and Dynamic Data Handling in Cloud Environments
👋 About the Project

This is my MCA Major Project (2024–2025). I built it to address one of the biggest challenges in cloud computing – making sure data is secure, private, and easy to share.

The idea is simple:

Owners should be able to encrypt and upload files to the cloud.

Users should be able to access only what they are allowed to see.

The system should support multiple owners, dynamic policies, and secure sharing.

Instead of depending fully on the cloud provider (which may not always be trustworthy), my project uses cryptographic techniques to give control back to the data owners.

🎯 What I Tried to Achieve

✔️ Confidentiality → Only authorized users can access files.

✔️ Multi-owner support → More than one owner can manage access policies.

✔️ Secure sharing → Owners can let others share data safely under conditions.

✔️ Better performance → Faster and more efficient than traditional systems.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend → HTML, JSP, JavaScript

Backend → Java, JDBC, Servlets

Server → Apache Tomcat

Database → MySQL

Other tools → NetBeans/Eclipse

🔑 Key Modules

Data Owner → Encrypts & uploads files.

Cloud Server (CSP) → Stores encrypted files.

Private Key Generator → Creates keys for decryption.

Data Disseminator → Shares files under certain conditions.

End User → Downloads/decrypts files if permitted.

✅ Testing

I tested the project with unit, integration, and user acceptance tests.
Everything worked as expected — file upload, secure sharing, and controlled access.

📌 Conclusion

Cloud storage is convenient, but security is always a concern.
This project gives users more control, privacy, and flexibility when sharing data.

🚀 Future Improvements

Stronger encryption algorithms

Two-factor login for more security

AI-based threat detection

A mobile app version for easy access

Support for AWS / Azure / Google Cloud
